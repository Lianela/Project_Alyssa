This is a local version of Alyssa, it will not run over OpenRouter or API Keys, it will not make any connection or even attempt, THIS IS TOTALLY UNSTABLE.<br/>
It will be used for depuration and fixes, it will not reflect the true changes for Alyssa, it will run locally using Ollama, for example, deepseek-r1:32b or llama3.1:latest (Llama 3.1 / 8b).

It can use llama3:70b-instruct-q4_K_M or deepseek-r1:70b but this need extremely powerful components, which, I lack of them at this moment.
