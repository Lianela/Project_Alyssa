# Heres a quick research that had been done with the following AIs:

###ChatGPT-o4, Llama 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek R1, Grok 3.

The results are interesting, so, here's a brief explanation:


591 / 5.000
The paper is a detailed exploration, through the responses of various AIs, of the fundamental differences between memory and human psychology (complex, biological, emotional, subjective, reconstructive) and the current and potential capabilities of AI to simulate these functions (based on algorithms, data, information retrieval, and behavioral simulation).<br/>
It concludes that while functional simulation of certain aspects is increasingly feasible, deep replication of the human mind remains an immense challenge, both technically and conceptually.
In summary, the paper uses a multi-AI question-and-answer format to conduct an in-depth, comparative exploration of human versus artificial memory, concluding that, although AI is making progress in simulating functions, the biological, emotional, and subjective essence of human memory remains unique and unreplicable with current technology.

The full paper is available with a request, for now, uploading the document due to it's lenght it's almost impossible to fit it in a readme or something, right now it's a PDF filled with all AIs answers using DeepThink and Search features, with DeepSearch from Gemini making it more complete.
